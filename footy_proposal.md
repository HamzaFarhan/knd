**Proposal for Football Computer Vision Model**

Hello! I hope you're doing great. I came across your job posting and believe I’d be an excellent fit. I've recently completed a very similar project — creating a system to detect and track specific football players using YOLOv8, and then deploying it in a user-friendly web app. I even wrote a detailed blog post about it, which you can view here:  
[**Ronaldo/Messi Individual Highlights Maker using YOLOv8 Detection and Tracking**](https://medium.com/@dreamai/ronaldo-messi-individual-highlights-maker-using-yolov8-detection-and-tracking-in-streamlit-0983a1ebeca6)

This demonstrates both my practical ability and end-to-end experience in computer vision solutions, from data gathering and labeling to final deployment.

## Why I’m a Good Fit
- **Deep Experience**: I have hands-on experience training computer vision models, including object detection and tracking tasks (e.g., YOLOv8-based player detection and highlight generation).
- **Proven Workflow**: My blog post and the accompanying code serve as evidence of a structured approach, so you can trust my expertise.
- **Passion for Sports and AI**: I share your enthusiasm for sports-oriented AI solutions and understand the nuances of detecting and tracking players, referees, and the ball.

## Proposed Rate and Timeline
- **Hourly Rate**: $30/hour  
- **Total Estimated Time**: Approximately **1.5 months**  

A 1.5-month period ensures a robust pipeline: from data preparation and labeling to final deployment.

## Detailed Plan (1.5 Months)

Below is an overview of the project steps. These mirror the structure I’ve successfully implemented before:

1. **Data Gathering and Labeling (Weeks 1 - 2)**  
   - Collecting and compiling raw video footage of amateur football matches.  
   - Labeling frames to identify players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball.  
   - Using a labeling tool (e.g., Roboflow or similar) for efficient annotation and data organization.

2. **Model Training (Weeks 2 - 3)**  
   - Preparing data splits (train/val/test) to ensure consistent performance evaluation.  
   - Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLOv8) on the curated dataset.  
   - Monitoring and improving performance metrics (precision, recall, mAP).

3. **Model Testing & Validation (Week 3 - 4)**  
   - Running inference tests on new, unseen video clips.  
   - Checking detection and tracking accuracy across different lighting conditions, angles, and match settings.  
   - Tuning hyperparameters, adjusting confidence thresholds, and refining bounding-box predictions.

4. **Deployment Preparation (Week 4 - 5)**  
   - Structuring the final pipeline for practical use (e.g., splitting large videos, filtering relevant frames, concatenating highlight clips).  
   - Designing a clean interface for end users to upload videos and view results (potentially with a framework like Streamlit).

5. **Final Integration & Launch (Week 5 - 6)**  
   - Integrating the model and pipeline into an environment or platform of your choice (e.g., cloud server, local application).  
   - Ensuring easy usage and minimal friction for non-technical users.  
   - Final checks on performance, followed by documentation and handover.

This timeline ensures each phase is handled properly without compromising on quality or thoroughness.

## Reference to Similar Work

- **Practical Demo**: My blog post walks through a real-world example. It showcases how I:
  - Gathered data (frames from matches),
  - Labeled those frames (players, teammates, opponents),
  - Trained a YOLOv8 model,  
  - Implemented a custom pipeline to extract highlights, and  
  - Deployed it in a Streamlit app for accessible usage.
